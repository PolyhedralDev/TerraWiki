# What is YAML?

YAML, short for 'YAML Ain't Markup Language' is a human-readable *data-serialization* language, commonly used for configuration files. The majority of Terra configuration files are written in YAML, which we've picked as the primary format for its simple syntax and easy readability compared to other data-serialization languages. Because Terra is centered around configurable world generation, it will be important to have a basic understanding of how to write in YAML if you wish to configure things yourself.

YAML files are like any other text file, meaning they can be opened, created, and edited in any text editor. These files conventionally use either the `.yaml` or `.yml` file extension.
