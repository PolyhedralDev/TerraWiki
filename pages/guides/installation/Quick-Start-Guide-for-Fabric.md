> This guide is intended for the **Fabric** version of Terra. See the [Getting Started Page](./Quick-Start-Guide) for
> guides on other platforms.

This guide covers the installation of Terra for both client and server versions of Fabric.

If you have already installed Terra or already know how to install Fabric mods, you can skip to the world setup guide
for your relevant setup:

* [Setting up a World on a Fabric Client](./Creating-a-Terra-World-on-a-Fabric-Client)

* [Setting up a World on a Fabric Server](./Creating-a-Terra-World-on-a-Fabric-Server)

### Download & Installation

1. Download the latest Terra Fabric release from the Modrinth website
[here](https://modrinth.com/mod/terra).

2. Once you have downloaded the `.jar` file from Modrinth, simply place the file into your `mods` folder located inside 
your Minecraft client or server directory.

  > Make sure you grab the correct version! Don't get the file named forge, or the file listed for a different minecraft
  > version.

3. Once the mod has been installed, start your client or server.

4. Once minecraft has loaded, check your logs for the following line to ensure everything has been installed correctly:
   
    ```none
    [XX:XX:XX] [main/INFO]: Loaded config pack "DEFAULT" vX.X.X by dfsek in XXXX.XXms.
    ```

    This means that the mod has loaded successfully, and that the *default* **Configuration Pack** has been unpacked and
    loaded correctly without issues.

After you have successfully installed Terra, refer to the relevant guide for how to set up a Terra world:

* [Setting up a World on a Fabric Client](./Creating-a-Terra-World-on-a-Fabric-Client)

* [Setting up a World on a Fabric Server](./Creating-a-Terra-World-on-a-Fabric-Server)
