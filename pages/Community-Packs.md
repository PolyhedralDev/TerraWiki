# Partial Packs

> The following packs are intended to provide a small handful of content such as a few biomes, collections of structures,
> and or other miscellaneous configs.
> 
> Potential applications of partial packs may include:
> * Merging content such as biomes and structures into other packs.
> * Using the pack generation as a canvas for building.
> * Generating themed event worlds.
> 
> These packs may not contain enough content to warrant standalone use, and may require some knowledge of Terra
> configurations for applications like merging into other packs.
