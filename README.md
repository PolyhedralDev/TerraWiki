# Contributing
Looking to contribute to the wiki? Awesome! If contributing, we ask that you keep a few things in mind:
* Use proper Markdown formatting. Use formatting in your pages; don't make them gigantic blocks of text. Use headings
that make sense, lists, tables, and anything else that increases the readability and searchability of pages. If you are
unfamiliar with Markdown, GitHub has a [Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
* Keep line length under 120 characters. Most IDEs and text editors support showing a column at a certain line length,
to make sure you don't go over 120 characters, we recommend you use this feature.
* Use proper grammar. This is an obvious one, but check your pages! Some IDEs have spelling and grammar checking
built-in for Markdown, if yours doesn't, be sure to check it manually before submitting a PR!

To contribute to this wiki, simply create a fork of this repository, add your page(s) to the `/pages/` folder, and
